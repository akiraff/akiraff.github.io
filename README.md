# Hello, I'm Fang Fang

Welcome to my personal webpage! After graduating with a B.S. degree in physics from USTC, I moved to UC Berkeley to continue my path as an experimental physics researcher, under the supervision of Prof. Dan Stamper-Kurn. My Ph.D. study has been focused on spin excitations in Bose-Einstein condensate and cold atomic mixtures. I was fascinated and still impressed by the level of precision we can control and manipulate atoms and molecules via modern experimental atomic, molecular and optics (AMO) techniques. I received my Ph.D. degree in physics on Dec 2019. After the pandemic, I moved to Harvard University as a postdoc researcher, collaborating with Prof. Norman Yao and Prof. Kang-Kuen Ni. I switched my research focus from cold bulk atomic gas to single atom held in optical tweezer. This well-controlled atom array is an excellent candidate for quantum simulation and computation. With a newly-built quantum simulator based on cesium atoms, I conducted research on probing critical phenomena via adiabatic state preparation method. This website contains a series of products and achievements of myself as a scientist, as well as extracurricular activities as a manga-fan, an enthusiast of painting and street dancing (Recent!).
